# List of features

## Support for [entity changes](https://crates.io/crates/substreams-entity-change/)

Support for these entity change operations:

- `OPERATION_CREATE`: The received entity changes are directly inserted into ClickHouse according to the provided [schema](#table-initialization).

- `OPERATION_UPDATE`: By default, updates are treated as new items. This allows to build an history of every transaction. If required, previous records can be replaced by specifying the engine as `ReplacingMergeTree`. See this [article](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/guides/developer/deduplication#using-replacingmergetree-for-upserts).

- `OPERATION_DELETE`: Entity changes are not actually deleted from the database. Again, this allows to build an history of every transaction. The deleted fields are inserted into `deleted_entity_changes`. This table can then be used to filter out deleted data if required.

## ~~Support for [database changes](https://crates.io/crates/substreams-database-change)~~ (WIP)

This feature has not been implemented yet.

## Table initialization

### SQL schemas

### GraphQL schemas

### Materialized View

## Automatic block metadata

Data for each block is stored alongside every record. The fields and their structure can be found in the [database structure](./database.md).

## Serverless

The ClickHouse sink is stateless. It can be scaled as needed.

## Authentication

Some endpoints are protected in the following manner.

### Basic authentication for users

_To disable authentication for users, set `AUTH_KEY=` in `.env`. Suggested for development_

Generate a hash for a password and set in `.env` as `AUTH_KEY`.<br/>
Further PUT requests will require the password in the `Authoriation` header.

```bash
$ curl --location 'localhost:3000/hash' --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data '<password>'
```

### ed25519 signatures for [webhooks](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-sink-webhook)

Each incoming payload (`POST /webhook`) is expected to be signed with the following headers. This signature is generated by the [webhook sink](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-sink-webhook).

```bash
x-signature-ed25519 = <signature>
x-signature-ed25519-expiry = <expiry-unix-format>
x-signature-ed25519-public-key = <public-key>
```

The token must not be expired.<br/>
The public key must be set in the [environment](../README.md#environment). Many public keys can be set in a comma separated list.<br/>
The signature must match the payload `{ exp: <expiry>, id: <id> }`.

If any of these criterias are not met, the sink will return an error code.

## No data loss

The substreams sink ensures no data loss.<br/>
This is done by saving every record locally in SQLite before sending a response to the [webhook sink](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-sink-webhook).

SQLite is then periodically saved into ClickHouse when the sink is running.<br/>
It can also be done when starting the sink by setting `--resume true` (on by default).

## Pause

The sink can be paused if needed. This allows ClickHouse to be modified without losing blocks.<br/>
The sink will return **HTTP 400** error code when paused.<br/>
The sink will behave normally when unpaused.

```bash
$ # Pause
$ curl --location --request PUT 'localhost:3000/pause' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <password>'
$ # Unpause
$ curl --location --request PUT 'localhost:3000/unpause' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <password>'
```
